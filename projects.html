<h1 align="left">Hardware Components of a Computer</h1>
<pre align="left">This was my first project at IIT Roorkee. In this project, I scoured through 
the internet to learn as much as I could about 25 hardware components of the computer including
input/output, storage, and processing devices. Through this project, I learn that the computer
is modular, and we can replace parts inside it without much difficulty once the CPU has been
opened.
