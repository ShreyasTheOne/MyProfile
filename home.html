<pre>  I am a student in the first year of my B. Tech 
  program in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT 
  Roorkee. My hometown is in Karnataka, but I can't 
  really say that's my home. I've also lived in Mumbai,
  USA, as well as Pune. I have made so many friends and
  memories in each of these places that I can't give 
  the title of 'home' to a 'single' location. Currently,
  I live in Roorkee. I like to eat spicy food, ride my 
  bike while listening to music, make bad puns and laugh 
  really hard. I've taken up computer science as my major 
  for now, but who knows what I'll be doing in four years?
