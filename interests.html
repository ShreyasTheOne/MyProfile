<h2>Learning Interests in B.Tech</h2>
<h1 align="left">Android App Development</h1>
<img id="app" src="android.png" width=" 172" height="176">
<pre align="left">  Apps have always appealed to me because they are so easy to use. I first tried to
  make an android app in tenth grade and I loved the experience. However, I had to 
  take a respite from app development to prepare for JEE. Now that I can get my hands 
  on Android Studios again, I hope to develop  even better and more useful apps in the future.

<h1 align="left">Machine Learning</h1>
<img id="ai" src="ai.jpg" width="348" height="200">
<pre align="left">  Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems
  the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being
  explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs
  that can access data and use it learn for themselves. If I learn to develop artificial 
  intelligence, I can use it to develop softwares that can greatly benefit the world.

<h1 align="left">Competitive Programming</h1>
<img id="cp" src="icpc.png" width="158" height="185">
<pre align="left">  I like to code in java, especially creating algorithms to solve problems. It challenges
  me to think in different dimensions and tests my IQ. That is why I hope to join PAG IITR, and someday
  represent my institute at the ICPC world finals.
